  # Unofficial Bio
  
I’m Holly Hilliard from Hillsboro, Ohio, and I appreciate alliteration!

I grew up in a town of 6,000 or so people in the Appalachian foothills. The cool kids were very into football, but I preferred choir, concert band, and reading books about dragons. I attended Duke University and surprised everyone by choosing to camp out in K-Ville for basketball tickets pretty much every spring.

I was an intern at One Story magazine and at Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill before working as an assistant at a literary agency in NYC. I left publishing to work in legal operations, but my dream of being a writer could not be quashed (legal joke!). In 2019, I graduated with an MFA in Creative Writing from North Carolina State University, where I completed a short story collection, taught fiction workshops for undergrads, and guzzled coffee well past 4 PM. I moved to Madison, Wisconsin and then to Pittsburgh, PA.

Now, I’m hard at work on a YA novel as well as some short stories for adults. When I’m not writing, I’m birding! I have many favorite birds, but today it’s the sandhill crane. Did you know the oldest confirmed sandhill crane fossil was found in Florida and estimated to be 2.5 million years old?
