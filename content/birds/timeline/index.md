Everyone comes to birds differently. Here are the things that got me excited about birding.

1) I read a book about birds.

This was when I was still working in publishing. I only read a few very early pages from a yet-to-be-published book about bird migration, but suddenly I found myself thinking, "Wow. Birds are neat!" If you're looking for good books about birds or nature, I recommend Scott Weidensaul's [A World on the Wing](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393608908), Aimee Nezhukumatathil's [World of Wonders](https://milkweed.org/author/aimee-nezhukumatathil), and the classic [A Sand County Almanac](https://www.aldoleopold.org/about/aldo-leopold/sand-county-almanac/) by Aldo Leopold.

2) I watched online bird cams.

My coworkers recommended a few different bird cams to me, including an NYU Hawk Cam that I believe is no longer in existence. I later found more cams through the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/cams/). The Cornell FeederWatch Cam was super helpful in learning my backyard birds (and getting to see what they looked like up close!).

3) I signed up for FeederWatch.

Even though I was living in a second-floor apartment at the time, I bought one of those bird feeders that suction to the outside of your window, and I was shocked to find that the birds actually liked it! I got lots of black-capped chickadees and house finches, so I joined FeederWatch that winter.

[FeederWatch](https://feederwatch.org/) is a program that lets you count the bird species that come to your feeder from the months of November to April. You enter the data online. Thousands of people across the US participate, so scientists use the data to understand how birds are doing in different areas throughout the winter. It was fun to be able to contribute to important bird research and to pay attention to the birds right outside my window.

4) I went on bird outings.

My first ever bird outing was called a "Bird and Nature Adventure" through [Madison Friends of Urban Nature](https://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/events/bird-nature.cfm). We rode in a pontoon on Lake Monona and saw lots of bank swallows. I was so impressed with our bird guide - he was able to tell the difference between birds in flight! I didn't know people could do that!

Over the years I also started attending bird outings with the Madison Chapter of the [Feminist Bird Club](https://www.feministbirdclub.org/). That's where I met most of my birding friends! 

No matter what outing I go on, I try to make it a goal to learn just one thing, whether it's a new bird fact I didn't know before, a tip about where to find birds in my area, or a new bird sound.

5) I volunteered with [Madison Audubon](https://madisonaudubon.org/volunteer).

I started volunteering with the seed collecting program in 2019. Every Saturday, my husband and I went out to one of the Audubon sanctuaries and learned about a new prairie plant, then helped collect seeds that Madison Audubon would use to restore prairies in the area.

Later, we also joined [Bald Eagle Nest Watch](https://madisonaudubon.org/bald-eagle-nest-watch). We watched an eagle nest once a week from January to July and recorded our observations about what was happening in the nest. I loved the program so much that I also signed up for the [Kestrel Nestbox Monitoring Program](https://madisonaudubon.org/kestrels), where I got to check a kestrel box once a week and eventually attend a kestrel banding session. In three years, my nest box never did attract a kestrel pair, but it was still fun to try.

6) I got binoculars.

They're 10x42s and they are so much better than the little kiddie binoculars I was using before. Once I got used to using them, I started noticing EVERYTHING. Robins have white feathers under their tails! House finches have lines on their tummies! From that moment forward I started going on walks nearly every day, trying to find more birds.

If you're looking for binoculars, I recommend checking out your local library or other local bird clubs; they often have binoculars available for borrowing. (See this [article](https://www.audubon.org/news/dont-have-binoculars-go-birding-try-borrowing-pair-library) for details!) The Madison Chapter of the Feminist Bird Club even raised money to create birding backpacks with the Madison Public Library. All packs come with binoculars and custom bird guides that anyone with a library card can check out!

7) I got a camera.

After a few years of birding with binoculars only, I felt like I'd hit a wall. It was hard to learn fall warblers, for example, without being able to capture a quick photo and compare it to a reference guide later. But cameras are expensive! Eventually my husband did lots of research and was able to buy a refurbished Nikon D7500 and a Sigma lens. Now, taking photos has become a fun hobby for me, and it has really helped me learn some of the trickier bird IDs. 

What's next on my bird journey? I have no idea! But I'm excited that there's so much to learn.
