Holly's birding timeline:

2010: I took Italian in college, and we learned how to talk about things we liked and didn't like. I told everyone I didn't like birds. It was easy to say, plus the only birds I ever noticed were the house sparrows eating crumbs on the plaza. They didn't seem particularly clean.

2016: I was working in publishing when I encountered a book proposal by a science writer. It was all about bird migration. Suddenly I found myself thinking, "Wow. Birds are cool."

2017: I started watching bird cams. Specifically, an NYU Hawk Cam that no longer exists. I later found more cams cams through the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/cams/). 

July 2019: I signed up for a "Pontoon Bird Cruise" through [Madison Friends of Urban Nature](https://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/events/bird-nature.cfm). We saw lots of bank swallows. I was so impressed with the bird guy on board - he was able to tell the difference between birds in flight! How?

September 2019: I started volunteering through [Madison Audubon](https://madisonaudubon.org/volunteer)'s seed collecting program. It was so nice to be outside every Saturday morning in the fall. 

Later that month, I saw my first sandhill crane, and I thought my life would never be the same.

Christmas 2019: Michael got me binoculars. They're 10x42s and they are so much better than the little kiddie binoculars I was using before. I started noticing EVERYTHING. Robins have white feathers under their tails! House finches have lines on their tummies! From that moment forward I started going on bird walks nearly every day. 

If you're looking for binoculars, by the way, I recommend checking out your local library or other local bird clubs; they often have binoculars available for borrowing. The Madison Chapter of the Feminist Bird Club even raised money to create birding backpacks with the Madison Public Library: all packs come with binoculars and custom bird guides that anyone with a library card can check out!

January 2020: Michael and I started monitoring an eagle nest through [Bald Eagle Nest Watch](https://madisonaudubon.org/bald-eagle-nest-watch). We watched our eagles once a week from January to July. It gave us something to look forward to during those long COVID months.

April 2021: I went on my first outing with the Madison Chapter of the [Feminist Bird Club](https://www.feministbirdclub.org/). It was all downhill from there!
