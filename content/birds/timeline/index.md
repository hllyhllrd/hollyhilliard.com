Holly's birding timeline:

**2010**: I took Italian in college, and we learned how to talk about things we liked and didn't like. I remember telling everyone that I didn't like birds. It was easy to say in Italian, plus the only birds I ever noticed were the house sparrows eating crumbs on the plaza. I wasn't particularly interested in them.

**2015**: I was working in publishing when I encountered a book proposal by a science writer. It was all about bird migration. Suddenly I found myself thinking, "Wow. Birds are cool."

**2017**: I started watching online bird cams at the urging of my coworkers. Specifically, an NYU Hawk Cam that I believe is no longer in existence. I later found more cams through the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/cams/). 

**July 2019**: I signed up for a "Bird and Nature Adventure" through [Madison Friends of Urban Nature](https://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/events/bird-nature.cfm). We rode in a pontoon on Lake Monona and saw lots of bank swallows. I was so impressed with our bird guide - he was able to tell the difference between birds in flight! I didn't know people could do that!

**September 2019**: I started volunteering through [Madison Audubon](https://madisonaudubon.org/volunteer)'s seed collecting program. It was so nice to be outside every Saturday morning in the fall. 

Later that month, I saw my first sandhill crane, and I thought my life would never be the same.

**Christmas 2019**: My husband got me binoculars. They're 10x42s and they are so much better than the little kiddie binoculars I was using before. I started noticing EVERYTHING. Robins have white feathers under their tails! House finches have lines on their tummies! From that moment forward I started going on bird walks nearly every day. 

If you're looking for binoculars, by the way, I recommend checking out your local library or other local bird clubs; they often have binoculars available for borrowing. The Madison Chapter of the Feminist Bird Club even raised money to create birding backpacks with the Madison Public Library: all packs come with binoculars and custom bird guides that anyone with a library card can check out!

**January 2020**: My husband and I started monitoring an eagle nest through [Bald Eagle Nest Watch](https://madisonaudubon.org/bald-eagle-nest-watch). We watched our eagles once a week from January to July. It gave us something to look forward to during those long COVID months, and we remained avid nest watchers for the next three years until moving to PA.

**April 2021**: I went on my first outing with the Madison Chapter of the [Feminist Bird Club](https://www.feministbirdclub.org/). 

**Christmas 2021**: I got my Nikon D7500 so I could take photos of birds. I'm still learning!
