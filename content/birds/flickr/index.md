I try to keep my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/196943877@N07/) page fairly updated with my latest bird and nature photos. I take photos with a Nikon D7500 and a Sigma Contemporary 150-600 mm lens. 

I have also had my photos published in the San Diego Union Tribune and in Wisconsin People & Ideas magazine.
