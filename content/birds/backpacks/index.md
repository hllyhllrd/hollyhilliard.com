My local [Feminist Bird Club](https://www.feministbirdclub.org/) chapter used our 2022 [Birdathon](https://www.wisconservation.org/great-wisconsin-birdathon/) donations to create birding backpacks with the Madison Public Library. All packs come with binoculars and custom bird guides that anyone with a library card can check out! I helped create the guides for the Pinney and Hawthorne branches.
